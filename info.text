1. Installing rust = done

2.Initialize a project: the command is :  cargo
there are two types of projects in rust
    .binaries: like an end user app(backend of an app, a cli, a dictionary assignment code) - the final production application
        : cmd = cargo init
    .libraries: end user app uses libraries
        : cmd = cargo init --lib

3. run cargo: the command is : cargo run
4. functions, conditinals, signed unsigned integer, calling the function
5. mutable variables:
    : whose values can change, let mut number = 5;
    : any variable that is defined in rust is by default a constant
